Kamal
Role: World/Tree Lead
Contributions:
• Designed and implemented the binary tree representing the game world with 7+ nodes.
• Added helper functions: createNode(), createWorld(), and traversal methods (preorder, inorder, postorder).
• Implemented memory cleanup (deleteTree) and search functionality (findByName).
• Created a clear structure for world representation and ensured integration readiness for game loop and save/load features.
Challenges:
• Balancing simplicity with flexibility for future features like save/load.
• Ensuring traversal outputs were clear and useful for debugging.
• Avoiding overly complex logic while maintaining readability.
Learnings:
• Gained practical experience in recursive tree operations and memory management.
• Learned how modular design improves collaboration in multi-person projects.
• Understood the importance of planning data structures for integration with other modules (inventory and game loop).
